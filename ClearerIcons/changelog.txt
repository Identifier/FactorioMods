  Icons:
    - Petroleum gas icon is purple to match the default color in pipes.
    - Uranium-235 is slightly brighter (matching the tip of the atomic bomb icon) to better distinguish it from the darker Uranium-238.
    - Speed module's lights have more contrast, more closely matching the contrast of the lights on the Efficiency and Productivity modules.
    - Fluoroketone (hot) internal color better resembles Fluoroketone (cold) rather than Lubricant.
    - Ammoniacal solution better matches the blue color in Ammonia to help distinguish it from Crude oil.
