# Clearer Icons

This mod replaces some of the icons with adjusted in-game sprites or colors that fit the visual style of the game.

* Petroleum gas icon is purple to match the default color in pipes.
* Uranium-235 is slightly brighter (matching the tip of the atomic bomb icon) to better distinguish it from the darker Uranium-238.
* Speed module's lights have more contrast, more closely matching the contrast of the lights on the Efficiency and Productivity modules.
* Fluoroketone (hot) internal color better resembles Fluoroketone (cold) rather than Lubricant.
* Ammoniacal solution better matches the blue color in Ammonia to help distinguish it from Crude oil.
