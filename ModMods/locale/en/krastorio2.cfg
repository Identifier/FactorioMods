modmods-give-logistic-roboport-construction-radius=Give roboports in "Logistic mode" a construction radius
modmods-extra-logistic-roboport-construction-radius=Additional construction radius for "Logistic mode" roboports

[mod-setting-description]
modmods-give-logistic-roboport-construction-radius=By default, roboports set to Krastorio 2's "Logistic mode" have a construction radius of 0, meaning they can't even clean up crashed robots.  By enabling this setting, roboports in "Logistic mode" will have a construction radius equal to their logistic radius.
modmods-extra-logistic-roboport-construction-radius=Any additional construction radius to add outside of the logistic radius when the previous setting is enabled.  By default, when the previous setting is enabled, the construction radius and logistics radius match, meaning you can't see the green construction zone underneath the orange logistics zone.  This setting allows you to add a little extra construction radius to make the construction zone visible.
