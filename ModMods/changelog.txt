Version: 0.0.1
Date: 2023-01-23
  Features:
    - Fixes some discrepancies between the base game and Krastorio 2 icons for oil processing.
  Krastorio 2:
    - Brings back the base game icons for Light and Heavy oil instead of Krastorio 2's new icons.
    - Makes the icon for Petroleum Gas the same color as the fluid in pipes/tanks (purple).
    - Uses the Petroleum Gas icon for the basic-oil-processing recipe, since Krastorio 2 uses the
      Light Oil icon and Heavy Oil icon for advanced-oil-processing and oil-processing-heavy respectively.
