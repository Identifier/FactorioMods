Circuit HUD:

    ☐ Investigate zooming
    Personal zoom sensitivity: 1.25959
    Max world zoom out level: 0.0157
    Default map zoom level: 0.0157
    Quick zoom out  map zoom level: 0.0001
    Map tags disappear after 0.015625001 (i.e. no map tags at 0.0156250009 or smaller).  Roughly equivalent to 1/64
    Available functions:
        player.open_map(position, scale?, entity?)
        player.zoom_to_world(position, scale?, entity?)
        player.close_map()
        player.render_mode
            render_mode.game (1) = normal game view, stuck to character position
            render_mode.chart_zoomed_in (3) = map view with visible in radar coverage
            render_mode.chart (2) = map view
        player.zoom (write-only)
        player.position (inherited)
    Look into:
        player.display_resolution
        player.display_scale
        player.gui    
        player.set_controller
        player.teleport (inherited)
        event on_selected_entity_changed
        event on_position_changed
    ? When in map view, and pressing satellite view buttion, space exploration somehow knows where I'm looking in order to make satellite view match?
    ! It's based on the cursor!

New Mod:
